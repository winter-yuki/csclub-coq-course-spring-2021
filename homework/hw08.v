(** * Exercise: finish the development we started at the last seminar *)

(** * Odd and even numbers *)

(** ** Part 1: Definitions *)

Section OddAndEven.

(** The goal of this exercise is to build a system of canonical structures
    so that the following statement about some properties of
    odd natural numbers can be proved with a couple of simple rewrites:

    Example test_odd (n : odd_nat) :
      ~~ (odd 6) && odd (n * 3).
    Proof. by rewrite oddP evenP. Qed.

    See the definitions of [odd_nat], [oddP], and [evenP] below.
    If you do everything the right way the example at the end of the section will work.
    In other words, the goal of this exercise is not to prove a statement,
    but rather make the given proof work.
    Please, DO NOT CHANGE the proof (I can assure you it works if the right canonical structures are given)
 *)


(** Let us define a structure defining the notion of odd numbers *)
Structure odd_nat := Odd {
  oval : nat;            (** [oval] is a natural number *)
  oprop : odd oval       (** [oprop] is the proof it is odd *)
}.

(** Example: [42 - 1] is an odd number *)

Definition o41 : odd_nat := @Odd 41 isT.

(** One issue here is that we cannot, for instance, add two odd naturals: *)
Fail Check o41 + o41.

(** Let's declare [oval] a coercion to work with terms of type [odd_nat]
    as if those were just regular naturals.
 *)
Coercion oval : odd_nat >-> nat.

Check o41 + o41.    (** Notice the result type is [nat] here: to use [odd_nat] as [nat] we forget the
                        extra information about oddity *)

(** Prove the main property of [odd_nat] *)
Lemma oddP {n : odd_nat} : odd n.
Proof.
Admitted.

(** Let us do the analogous thing for the even numbers *)
Structure even_nat := Even {
  eval :> nat;
  eprop : ~~ (odd eval)
}.

(* Prove the main property of [even_nat] *)
Lemma evenP {n : even_nat} : ~~ (odd n).
Proof.
Admitted.


(** Now we have all the definitions we referred to in the problem definition.  *)

(** The objective is to make it work: knowing that
    [n] is [odd] Coq should infer that [n * 3]
    is also [odd], and that [6] is even *)
Example test_odd (n : odd_nat) : ~~ (odd 6) && odd (n * 3).
Proof. Fail by rewrite oddP evenP. Abort.

(** But Coq cannot infer it without any hints.
    The goal to provide the necessary hints in the form of canonical structure instances *)

(** Let's start by telling Coq that 0 is even *)
Canonical even_0 : even_nat := @Even 0 replace_with_your_solution_here.

(** helper lemma *)
Lemma oddS n : ~~ (odd n) -> odd n.+1.
Proof.
Admitted.

(** helper lemma *)
Lemma evenS n : (odd n) -> ~~ (odd n.+1).
Proof.
Admitted.

(** Here we teach Coq that if [m] is even,
    then [m.+1] is [odd] *)
Canonical odd_even (m : even_nat) : odd_nat :=
  @Odd m.+1 replace_with_your_solution_here.

(** Implement the dual, teach Coq that if [m]
    is [odd] then [m.+1] is [even] *)
Canonical even_odd (m : odd_nat) : even_nat :=
  @Even m.+1 replace_with_your_solution_here.

(** Now let's deal with multiplication:
    DO NOT USE [case] tactic or the square brackets to
    destruct [n] or [m] *)
Lemma odd_mulP {n m : odd_nat} : odd (n * m).
Proof.
(** (!) do not break up [n] or [m] *)
Admitted.

(** Teach Coq that [*] preserves being [odd] *)
Canonical oddmul_Odd (n m : odd_nat) : odd_nat :=
  @Odd replace_with_your_solution_here replace_with_your_solution_here.

(** If the following proof works it means you did everything right: *)
Example test_odd (n : odd_nat) :
  ~~ (odd 6) && odd (n * 3).
Admitted.

End OddAndEven.


(** ** Part 2: Equality for [odd_nat] *)

(** We cannot use [==] on [odd] natural numbers because
   [odd_nat] is not an [eqType] *)
Fail Check forall n : odd_nat, n == n.

(** * Optional exercise: define [eqType] instance for [odd_nat] *directly* *)

Definition eq_odd_nat (m n : odd_nat) : bool :=
  replace_with_your_solution_here.
(* Hint: since you are comparing two structures you might think
   you need to check that both components of the structures are equal:
   this is not a problem for the first component of type [nat],
   but then you'll need to compare two *proofs* and this is
   tricky in general.
   However, here you actually don't need to compare the proofs at all:
   simply compare the first components and then you'll still be able
   to prove [Equality.axiom].
 *)

Lemma eq_odd_axiom : Equality.axiom eq_odd_nat.
Proof.
Admitted.
(*
 Hint 1: use [case: eqP] to case analyse on equality between natural numbers
         (you might need to do some definition unfolding before you can use it).

 Hint 2: use [eq_irrelevance] lemma (you might need to specify the exact
         occurence you want to rewrite like so rewrite [proof_name]eq_irrelevance).
*)



(** * Exercise: define [eqType] instance for [odd_nat] using [subType] *)

(* Since [odd_nat] is a subtype of natural numbers, i.e.
   a structure with a number and an additional (computable) constraint on it,
   we can use the [subType] machinery to derive equality (and not only equality)
   on it. *)
(* First, you derive [subType] instance by specifying the projection like: *)
Canonical oddnat_subType := Eval hnf in [subType for oval].

(* Then you derive the equality mixin be specifying the type: *)
Definition oddnat_eqMixin := Eval hnf in [eqMixin of odd_nat by <:].

(* Comment out the the line with [Canonical oddnat_subType] above and
   make sure deriving of [oddnat_eqMixin] fails. *)

(* Now finish the definition of [eqType] for [oddnat]: *)

(* ADD YOUR CODE HERE *)

(* This should work now *)
Check forall n : odd_nat, n == n.
Lemma odd_nat_eq_refl (n : odd_nat) :
  n == n.
Proof. by rewrite eq_refl. Qed.

(** * Exercise: Now deal with [even_nat] *)
Fail Check forall (m : even_nat), m == m.

(* ADD CODE HERE *)

Check forall (m : even_nat), m == m.

Lemma odd_nat_eq_refl (n : even_nat) :
  n == n.
Proof. by rewrite eq_refl. Qed.

==== OPTIONAL EXERCISES ====

Exercises in this section are not related to canonical structures
*)


(** An optional exercise with a short and a bit tricky one-line solution (less than 70 characters): *)
Lemma triple_compb (f : bool -> bool) :
  f \o f \o f =1 f.
Proof.
Admitted.
(** Hint: use [case <identifier>: <term>] tactic
          to pattern match on [<term>] and keep the result
          as an equation <identifier> in the context.
          E.g. [case E: b] where [b : bool] creates two subgoals with two equations
          in the context: [E = true] and [E = false] corresponingly.
